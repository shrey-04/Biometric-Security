USIT packages
=============

The packages contain software which is not part of the core USIT package. It
was taken from different publications and is packaged with the USIT for
convenience reasons.

Each subdirectory should be self contained and should contain the respective
software as well as a readme.md which outlines the license and usage
information (in case it differs from the core USIT).

Also note that windows binaries and makefiles might or might not be supplied in
the packages. However, unless noted otherwise in the individual packages the
requirements should be the same as for the base USIT package.
